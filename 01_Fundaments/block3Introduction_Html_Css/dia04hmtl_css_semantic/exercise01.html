        <p>Mantis shrimp, or stomatopods, are carnivorous marine crustaceans of the order Stomatopoda, branching from
          other members of the class Malacostraca around 340 million years ago.Mantis shrimp typically grow to around 10
          cm (3.9 in) in length, while a few can reach up to 38 cm (15 in).A mantis shrimp's carapace (the hard, thick
          shell that covers crustaceans and some other species) covers only the rear part of the head and the first four
          segments of the thorax. Varieties range in colour from shades of brown to vivid colours, with more than 450
          species of mantis shrimp being known. They are among the most important predators in many shallow, tropical
          and subtropical marine habitats. However, despite being common, they are poorly understood, as many species
          spend most of their lives tucked away in burrows and holes.</p>
        <p>Called "sea locusts" by ancient Assyrians, "prawn killers" in Australia,and now sometimes referred to as
          "thumb splitters"â€”because of the animal's ability to inflict painful wounds if handled incautiously, mantis
          shrimp have powerful raptorials that are used to attack and kill prey either by spearing, stunning, or
          dismembering. Some mantis shrimp species have specialised calcified "clubs" that can strike with great power,
          while others have sharp forelimbs used to seize the prey (hence the term "mantis" in its common name).</p>

        <h2>Look at those eyes!</h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Mantis_Shrimp_Eyes.JPG/220px-Mantis_Shrimp_Eyes.JPG" alt="Close-up of a mantis shrimp showing the structure of the eyes">
        <p>The eyes of the mantis shrimp are mounted on mobile stalks and can move independently of each other. They are
          thought to have the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom and have the most complex visual system ever
          discovered. Compared with the three types of photoreceptor cell that humans possess in their eyes, the eyes of
          a mantis shrimp have between 12 and 16 types of photoreceptor cells. Furthermore, some of these shrimp can
          tune the sensitivity of their long-wavelength colour vision to adapt to their environment. This phenomenon,
          called "spectral tuning", is species-specific. Cheroske et al. did not observe spectral tuning in
          Neogonodactylus oerstedii, the species with the most monotonous natural photic environment. In N. bredini, a
          species with a variety of habitats ranging from a depth of 5 to 10 m (although it can be found down to 20 m
          below the surface), spectral tuning was observed, but the ability to alter wavelengths of maximum absorbance
          was not as pronounced as in N. wennerae, a species with much higher ecological/photic habitat diversity. The
          diversity of spectral tuning in Stomatopoda is also hypothesized to be directly linked to mutations on the
          opsin gene's chromophore binding pocket.</p>
        <p>Despite the impressive range of wavelengths that mantis shrimp have the ability to see, they do not have the
          ability to discriminate wavelengths less than 25 nm apart. It is suggested that not discriminating between
          closely positioned wavelengths allows these organisms to make determinations of its surroundings with little
          processing delay. Having little delay in evaluating surroundings is important for mantis shrimp, since they
          are territorial and frequently in combat.</p>

        <h2>What about those claws.</h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Squilla_mantis.jpg/220px-Squilla_mantis.jpg"
          alt="squilla mantis, showing the spearing appendages">
        <p>The mantis shrimp's second pair of thoracic appendages has been highly adapted for powerful close-range
          combat. The appendage differences divide mantis shrimp into two main types: those that hunt by impaling their
          prey with spear-like structures and those that smash prey with a powerful blow from a heavily mineralised
          club-like appendage. A considerable amount of damage can be inflicted after impact with these robust,
          hammer-like claws. This club is further divided into three subregions: the impact region, the periodic region,
          and the striated region. Mantis shrimp are commonly separated into two distinct groups determined by the type
          of claws they possess:</p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>Smashers possess a much more developed club and a more rudimentary spear (which is nevertheless quite
              sharp and still used in fights between their own kind); the club is used to bludgeon and smash their meals
              apart. The inner aspect of the terminal portion of the appendage can also possess a sharp edge, used to
              cut prey while the mantis shrimp swims.</td>
              <td>Spearers are armed with spiny appendages - the spines having barbed tips - used to stab and snag prey.
              </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
